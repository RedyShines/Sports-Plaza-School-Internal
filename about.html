            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The Sports Plaza was founded in 1935 by a well known businessman named Johnathan Canebury. Back then, Sports Plaza was named "The Sporting Agency Of Auckland" or just "Sporting Agency '' dubbed by the locals. This little sportsground started as a large open field with a baseball field, rugby/soccer field and a tennis court. A few years after its opening, World war Two broke out, and sadly Johnathan died at war. That's when his son, Jeffrey Canebury decided to take over his fathers sports business in 1947. At the young age of 19, he decided to use most of his inheritance and invested into the rebuilding and rebranding of The Sports Agency, making a proper building to house all the sports in, while leaving some things outside like a nicer rugby court. The Sporting Agency was then reopened to the public, now known as “Sports Frenzy''. Everyone loved this new and playful sporting building, a one of a kind thing in New Zealand at that time, and because of that, it brought huge attention to the little building, which has been renovated and refurbished to bring it to its high standards today.</p>
            <h1>About Johnathan Canebury.</h1>
            <p>Jonathan Canbury was around the age of 35 when he first opened the Sporting Agency. With the wealth he had gotten being a door to door salesman and a banker, he had a good reputation among his community. So with his generosity he opened the Sporting Agency and the rest was history. Sadly he had passed away at the age of 47, ending his legacy there. We have no images of this legendary man, so what he looks like is a mystery to everyone except for his son Jeffrey Canebury.</p>
            <h1>About Jeffrey Canebury</h1>
            <p>Jeffrey Canebury is the current owner and CEO of the sports plaza, making millions a year and sharing his wealth with his community. He is known to be a rather generous man. If you asked him for a buck or two he would surely give you what you need. He reopened the sports plaza at the age of 21 in 1949. He is now in his late 50s, he is still giving and sharing every last penny he makes from his great father’s establishment.</p>
