            <h1>The wonderful history of Sports Plaza</h1>
            <p>The Sports Plaza was founded in 1935 by a well known businessman named Johnathan Canebury. Back then, Sports Plaza was named "The Sporting Agency Of Auckland" or just "Sporting Agency“ dubbed by the locals. This little sportsground started as a large open field with a baseball field, rugby/soccer field and a tennis court. A few years after its opening, World war Two broke out, and sadly Johnathan died at war. That's when his son, Jeffrey Canebury decided to take over his fathers sports business in 1947. At the young age of 19, he decided to use most of his inheritance and invested into the rebuilding and rebranding of The Sports Agency, making a proper building to house all the sports in, while leaving some things outside like a nicer rugby court. The Sporting Agency was then reopened to the public, now known as “Sports Frenzy”. Everyone loved this new and playful sporting building, a one of a kind thing in New Zealand at that time, and because of that, it brought huge attention to the little building. After years of refurnishing, and rebranding, We come to 50 years since Johnathan Canbury founded this wonderful agency in 1935, to the year 1985 today, where it is one of the most visited places in New Zealand history, and has won many awards. “I would have never expected that this little passion project of my father’s would get this far!” says Jeffrey. “My father would definitely be really proud of what I have done with his business. Not only because I’m bringing in the sweet sweet money, but also the wonderful community we have built around this! Millions of dollars spent on making a fun and enjoyable experience for everyone, and we can repay them by donating to charities, and helping out where needed. We are thankful for all of you who have enjoyed your stay with us, and hope you come back to have some more fun!”
                We still cannot thank you enough for all the support over the years, and here is for another 50 years!
